The Team Dynamics Puzzle

The Team Dynamics Puzzle is a lightweight, interactive demo designed to help leaders think differently about team composition. Instead of focusing on job titles or seniority, it explores how role balance and context shape team effectiveness.

This tool is intentionally simple and reflective—built for individual leaders to experiment, learn, and question their assumptions.

What This Demo Does

Allows users to select one scenario (e.g., Innovation, Execution, Crisis Management)

Prompts users to choose three team roles
(Plant, Implementer, Coordinator, Challenger, Completer)

Evaluates whether the selected roles are a strong fit, weak fit, or mismatch

Explains why the combination works or doesn’t

Highlights which roles were helpful and which created friction

Encourages users to reset and experiment again

The goal is learning through iteration—not “winning.”

What This Demo Does Not Do

No team comparisons

No facilitator mode

No saving or sharing results

No assessments, scoring, or personality labeling

No claim of predictive accuracy

This is not an HR system or diagnostic tool. It’s a thinking aid.

Framework Behind the Roles

The five roles are inspired by Belbin’s Team Role theory, simplified for clarity and usability:

Plant – Creative thinker, idea generator

Implementer – Turns ideas into action

Coordinator – Aligns people and decisions

Challenger – Questions assumptions, surfaces risk

Completer – Focuses on accuracy and follow-through

Rather than using all nine Belbin roles, this demo intentionally focuses on five core dynamics to keep cognitive load low and insights clear.

Why Context Matters

The same team can succeed in one scenario and struggle in another.

This demo reinforces a key idea:

Performance is often about fit, not talent.

Innovation, execution, and crisis situations demand different balances, not different “levels” of people.

Intended Audience

Leaders and managers

HR and People Ops professionals

Product and operations leaders

Anyone curious about organizational design and decision-making

No HR background required.

How to Use

Open index.html in a browser

Read the instructions at the top of the page

Select a scenario

Choose three roles

Review the feedback

Reset and try a different balance

Repeat until patterns start to emerge.

Philosophy

This demo was built from curiosity—not certainty.

It’s meant to spark reflection, dialogue, and better questions about:

Why teams struggle

Why strong individuals fail in certain contexts

Why “high performers” don’t always perform

Future Possibilities (Not Implemented)

Group facilitation mode

Workshop adaptations

Deeper scenario libraries

AI-assisted reflection prompts

Those are intentionally out of scope for now.

Feedback & Discussion

This project is a conversation starter.

If you’re a leader experimenting with team design—or building tools that support better decision-making—I’m always open to thoughtful discussion.
