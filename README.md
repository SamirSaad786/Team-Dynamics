# The Team Dynamics Puzzle

**The Team Dynamics Puzzle** is a lightweight, interactive demo designed to help leaders think differently about team composition.

Instead of focusing on job titles or seniority, it explores how **role balance and context** shape team effectiveness.

This tool is intentionally simple and reflective—built for individual leaders to experiment, learn, and question their assumptions.

## What This Demo Does

- Allows users to select **one scenario**  
  (Innovation, Execution, or Crisis Management)

- Prompts users to choose **three team roles**  
  *(Plant, Implementer, Coordinator, Challenger, Completer)*

- Evaluates whether the selected roles are a:
  - **Strong fit**
  - **Weak fit**
  - **Mismatch**

- Explains **why** the combination works or doesn’t

- Highlights:
  - Which roles were well-suited
  - Which roles created friction

- Encourages users to **reset and experiment again**

> The goal is learning through iteration — not “winning.”

## What This Demo Does *Not* Do

- No team comparisons  
- No facilitator or workshop mode  
- No saving or sharing results  
- No scoring, rankings, or personality labeling  
- No predictive or diagnostic claims  

This is **not** an HR system or assessment tool.  
It is a **thinking aid**.

## Framework Behind the Roles

The five roles are inspired by **Belbin’s Team Role framework**, intentionally simplified for clarity and usability.

### Core Roles Used

- **Plant** – Creative thinker, idea generator  
- **Implementer** – Turns ideas into action  
- **Coordinator** – Aligns people and decisions  
- **Challenger** – Questions assumptions, surfaces risk  
- **Completer** – Focuses on accuracy and follow-through  

Rather than using all nine Belbin roles, this demo focuses on **five core dynamics** to reduce cognitive load and keep insights clear.

## Why Context Matters

The same team can succeed in one scenario and struggle in another.

This demo reinforces a key idea:

> **Performance is often about fit, not talent.**

Innovation, execution, and crisis situations demand **different balances**, not different “levels” of people.

---

## Intended Audience

- Leaders and managers  
- HR and People Operations professionals  
- Product and operations leaders  
- Anyone curious about organizational design  

No HR background required.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser  
2. Review the instructions at the top of the page  
3. Select a scenario  
4. Choose three roles  
5. Read the feedback  
6. Reset and try a different balance  

Repeat until patterns start to emerge.

## Philosophy

This demo was built from curiosity—not certainty.

It’s meant to spark reflection and better questions about:
- Why teams struggle
- Why strong individuals fail in certain contexts
- Why “high performers” don’t always perform

---

## Future Possibilities (Not Implemented)

- Group facilitation mode  
- Workshop adaptations  
- Expanded scenario libraries  
- AI-assisted reflection prompts  

These are intentionally **out of scope** for now.

## 💬 Feedback & Discussion

This project is a conversation starter.

If you’re experimenting with team design—or building tools that support better leadership decisions—I’m always open to thoughtful discussion.
